So far it's working out some of the game mechanics so it doesn't look like much but theres a good amount of thinking behind whats happening. 

***
You play as the grey square - use arrow keys to move around. Collecting blue squares increases score. Notice that you're consistently dragged into the center. 
***

Eventually the blue squares will be replaced by sprites that represent various aspects of life (work, love-life, etc.. related images). Collecting certain types of objects will increase different scores (collecting a computer will add to wealth and mental health, but decrease love life). In each round, collecting a certain number of something will cause you to go down a different branch - showing symbolically that you have a preference for certain aspects of life which shape your overall path. 

The ulimate goal will be to find a balance between the various aspects of your life. There will be several scenes branching as your preferences in life become known. The center will represent sadness/depression. The more idle you are in life, the less happy you'll become.  

Originally I was going to make it like a point-and-click adventure. It's definitely evolved mechanically, but I think my original themes can persist while I favor a less exact story line (influence from Passage no doubt). I may not have a ton done, but I like the direction its heading in.

Let me know what you think! 

Maybe have quadrents of each life aspect. where do we spend our time - love area or work area? 
Make easier play cycle - too hard for Josephine
If offscreen, maybe have something
make direction easier
