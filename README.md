# Life Path (working title)

## Game Play

You play as the grey square - use arrow keys to move around through life and 'do' activities.  
Be aware that each activity takes time, how will you use yours?

## Description 

This game is about balance in life. Distilling life to three 'positive' ideas, Wealth, Happiness, Intelligence, and my own personal feelings of certain activities, you move through life. Each activity represented by an icon has associated Wealth, Happiness, Intelligence, and Time. Time will only ever be subtracted, but the others may increase or decrease. 

The game generally starts off chaotic, randomly encountering activites. As you start to get a feel for the game, you can start to cherry pick and cater your life. Think of each re-play as a new age, or a new chapter. Or don't, entirely up to you. 

Inspired heavily by Passage, works by Blast Theory, and serious games, Life Path is a meditation. Meant to be self reflective, the player is cast into my perceptions of work/life balance specifically related to my current thoughts and feelings. As you collect items, or activities rather, you gain or lose some things - work will add wealth, drinking will lose intelligence, etc... I reccomend multiple play-throughs - It's designed to be digestible and generally takes about 2 minutes. The pace changes as only getting an activity removes time. 

## Open Source
The settings are personal. That is this represents how I feel about certain aspects of life which you may disagree with. Feel free to fork/clone this game, change settings, add activities, or anything else! This is only my version, as I only experience my version of life.
